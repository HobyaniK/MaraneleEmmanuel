<p> Life is a journey full of obsticles. Sometime it take years to overcome these obsticles.</p>
<p> My dad is a hero who made all obsticles easier to remove.He is a hero among heroes.Each day of my life i think of him
Wishing he were here with me and my family. At time tears just run out of my eyes becaues of the joy that i have in my heart that 
God blessed me with a father like that. To me you will always be my dad, my hero and my everything. You have left a void in my heart dad
and i so wish you were here to say good bye when i take flight to different places. You always said i must go to school but you left 
this world without seeing mty success, without even seeing what i have accomplished because of your guidance.
</p>
<p>
I will always strive to be the best because i know that all you wanted from all you're kids.
Miss You Old MAN......Really Miss You
May God Be With You....
